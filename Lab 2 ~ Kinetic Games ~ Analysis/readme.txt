For this lab we were asked to pick a small website. 
I play a game called Phasmophobia, it's a ghost hunting game and its super fun. The developers Kinetic Games (https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/) has a very small website. So i deicided to use it for this lab.
I also did kind of figure out there is some things I do not like about their website. The header and footer stay the same in every page and I feel like it should change over time. 
I also hated that the social media buttons are on the top in the header but also on the footer as well. It kind of just overloads me. 
When I was looking at the impages and buttons that were used in the making of the website most of them did not have a file name or they file name was super super long or they were imported through somewhere else. 
The icons for the social media platforms all don't seem to have a icon file, it just says "no-icon", etc. 
I also felt like going through everything in a website and creating an asset list is no easy job. It took me 5-6 hours just to complete the asset inventory. The pages and figma park was easy but after that 
it was just down hill.
This was fun though even if it did take long and a lot of sweat and tears. It also was very hard to find a website that was small enough. I know I probably went over the 5 page limit but I had no idea there was policies and guildelines at the bottom. But they only were filled with text and nothing too big. So they were easy to fit in place. I deicdied to combine them with the homepage because the footer and header does not move.
But yeah this lab was very fun even if it was hard and too a long long time. I think the best way to asset inventory is when you are making the website instead of trying to sift through other peoples messy coding when inspecting another site.
