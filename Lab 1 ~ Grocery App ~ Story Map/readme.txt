My general thought process for creating this story map was to create a simple plan and to map out the grocery delivery app using the user perspective. 
My first primary focus was to root out my 3 epicsâ€™. I decided them by goal or the main goal, so the first one is the delivery side of course, the second the store side, and then the last one is the user side because that was the labs main focus. 
The Delivery side I didn't dive really deep on because this is user based. To me this grocery app is like UberEATS or Instacart. The delivery drives are the ones who pick up orders from the stores and then deliver them to the users. This could be user sided since drivers sign up and get placed at certain stores. 
The store side is just mainly a store partnering with the app and allowing users to purchase from them and have those items delivered. So, it could be user based as well. 
The last one is the customers. I put in the most effort in this section since the customers are the ones who are going to be using this app to pick stores to order groceries from. 

For the step's I tried to make them simple and if I needed to group some I did since I don't want the board to overflow. An example of it overflowing to me would be if I put all the things you needed to do to sign up for an account. So, I just put in a box, "customer details, store details". Just so it's more organized. 

For MVP's again I ended up just simplifying these like the customer details and store details, so it isn't too cluttered. And then the unscheduled tasks, I decided to pick the not so important ones that don't need to be a feature yet. 

The first decision I made was to try and make a timeline type map, the first epic is the driver/delivery person, the second is the store, and the third is the customer. It's like a little timeline of the process of getting groceries delivered, since you need drivers to deliver and then you need stores to get the items from and then you need customers to order so the stores can fulfill that order and then the deliver person can deliver. The timeline can go from the left and then to the right. 

The second decision I made was which tasks were going to be put into the app in the future, and when I say future, I mean the unscheduled tasks because those are the "not so important" ones at the moment. 

Another decision I made was to put in a lot of different features that customers would like, for example one of the flexible features would have to be "Modifying Quantity" and "removing items". I want the customers to be able to feel the flexibility at the check out and cart aspect of the app. 

With all these decisions I was able to successfully add in all of them and make them fit perfectly, while also looking organized. 

The extra feature I decided to try was the colors feature. I found this fun to use because it allows you to make any square or tab look separate from the others. I also made these ones the detailed tabs, so I am able to easily find them and take a screenshot of them for the lab.
