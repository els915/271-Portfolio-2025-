For this lab we were requested to do a story board on the user side of a grocery delivery app. 
My general thought process during this lab was mainly focused on the user side of the assignment and not so much the delivery or store side. I tried my best to keep everything simple and easy to understand.
I first planned out the 3 epic tasks, trying to make them the main goal of each section. The first section is of course the delivery aspect, the second is the store selling items aspect and lastly the last epic is the app side for the users. 
Those are all the main ideas/goals. The steps were planned out and simplified to try and make it orangized and less messy. I also took a look at some grocery delivery apps like saveonfoods, walmart. Those all helped me understand what user's would look for. 
In the MVP's I wanted to put all the small things that make all steps work, I kept them simplifed because I did not want to over do it and make it messy. So I put customer details, store details because there is so many different things that would have to go in that category.
I also added 3 unschedlued tasks that I saw weren't very needed until the future, like the pick multiple stores function, this could become a great feature in the future but right now people should only pick one store at a time to order from. Another one would be rating the stores, that can also wait a while to be published. 
I think my decisions during this lab were successful because I wanted to simplify a lot of things and also make it orangized instead of jam packing it full of multiple boxes.
The 1 feature I decided to play around with in the storyboards app was the color feature. The pink boxes are the ones that have the detailed descrptions, along with the funky fonts we were allowed to use. 
I really loved this lab, It was fun planning out the user side of an app, because to me I have experience using apps from a user perspective and I found this fun.
