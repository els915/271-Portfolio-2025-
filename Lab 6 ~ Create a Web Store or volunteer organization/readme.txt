For this lab we either had to choose to make a web store or volunteer organization. I decided to pick a web store just because I am currently making another website for a charity foundation and I needed a break from that formatting.
We got to use starter templates in this lab. I decided to use the template "life coach". There was many plant shop starter templates but this one caught my eye. I think the wavy image on the first page intrigued me.
I deleted most of the pages execpt the homepage. I then changed the header and footer, I also changed the image, text, logo, name, socials. 
I then added 3 links within the menu, Plants, contact us, and the blog.
The link to the plants I was just playing around with it and seeing what I could do. The link to the contact page was where I learned dhow to add text onto an image. The blog post page is where I learned that you can add in blocks into a container. 
I then made 3 blog posts listing 3 services. 
The first post was the product which is of course plants. 
The second post is a service where I repot the plants at a fee. 
The third post is another service of rehoming plants. 
I think I did a good job on this lab. I will include screen shots since I can not upload the zip file.
