For this lab we were told to make a persona. The persona had to be someone who was looking to buy concert tickets but also we had to create a person who liked music.
I picked a random name. I named her Lillian Straw. She loves pop music and is studying pop culture at the University of Regina. 
I wanted her to seem friendly and out going. 
For the website I have used wordpress before in CTCH 110 and CTCH 111. Even with experience i still hate wordpress with a passion. Once you get everything looking great you are happy and feel accomplished but when you are making the site you wanna crawl under a table and cry. 
For some reason my homepage in my site editor would not take me to the homepage that I had made. I made sure all pages and posts were deleted before I started with a template. The only way for me to get the homepage I made was to use the "Open site" feature on local or copy and paste the website link. 
I liked this lab but for wordpress, I have beef with wordpress.
