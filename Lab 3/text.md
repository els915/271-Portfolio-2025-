For this lab I decided to pick a mobile app to try and recreate. I did run into a few problems when I could not get the same color as the background of the phone screen, I also had to change the pictures of the dogs. It would have looked weird if i tried to use the screenshot with a different color background. But this lab was overall fun! It was like a scavenger hunt in my opinion! 

The creator of this mobile app design is Taras Miqulko who works for the company Emote. Emote makes different designs across the Dribbble website.
